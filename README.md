# LunaSampleGame

We wanted to provide the Luna commuinty with a free sample 2D game for your an introduction to Luna, to proivde an example on building Luna creatives. 

This sample game includes some of our free assets used for UI elements to create the end card for this game! 

You can check out our Free assets on our github community.

## What to do

Once game is opened up inside Unity and the Luna plug-in is installed, project can be built using the Luna UI and build a Playground version to be uploaded.

To access variables in Playground you will need to un-comment the luna atrrubutes code located in GameManager.cs and PauseManager.cs.

This game includes a finished example of an exportable Luna build that can be run on all the ad networks, meeting size and API requirements.
